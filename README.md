# JavaScript Book Tracker :blue_book:

## Overview

The goal of this application is to provide the ability to track reading progress. 
This is an application for a friend who is an avid reader and looking for a simple way 
to track his progress. 

## Features

Some of the things that this application will allow: 

- The ability to add and delete a book to storage
- Form entries for title, author, pages, and read status
- Dynamic, mobile friendly UI

### Future goals

I am not very far into the project yet, but my goals are to make a user authentication system. 
Allow the user to create an account, log in, and track their data outside of local storage.

## Technologies/methodologies 

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Object Oriented Programming

I'm choosing this classic trio to get back to fundamentals and really hone those skills. I'm using object oriented 
approaches to better organize my code. As for as a backend goes, i'm on the fence between making my own, or outsourcing.

## Challenges

I'm not super far into this project yet, but one challenge I had was regarding the UI. I wanted a visually appealing and intuitive way for the
user to add data. I was able to achieve this by blurring the background when the user opens the form. It was a seemingly simple task, but was fairly difficult.
Another difficulty i'm having is with organizing code and reducing variables from other files from changing. I think I can solve this by wrapping code in 
my file with an immediately invoked function. 

## How to use 

Eventually this will be hosted, but you are more than welcome to fork this repo and run this project locally. I don't currently have any dependenies.
